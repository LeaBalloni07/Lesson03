          <img src="images/VisciousCycles.png" alt="Home Page of Viscious Cycles Project">
          <p>Viscious Cycles was a project I did for my WEB-140 class. It was the introductory class into HTML and CSS. The Project was for a fictional local bicycle store. Requirements for the class was to create at least 4 internal pages. A fluid layout. Links to various sites including social media pages. The site had to be responsive, and also had to include form and some validation. We were given freedom on color choices and also to add to the site if we feel like we can and want to. </p>
